# TonyPi-Humanoid-Robot
This repository contains some of the work I did on the TonyPi humanaoid robot


The developed codes use the libraries provided by Hiwonder. 
In this repository I used the SerialServoCmd.py and config_serial_servo.py libraries which were developed by Hiwonder
Please find their work and documentation on this robot in the link below

** Note that the programs I wrote named "main.py" and "ServoRestPosition.py" only works for the lower limb joint and does not consider the arms of the robot.
